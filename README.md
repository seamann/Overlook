# Overlook

[![Xcode - Build](https://github.com/rcawston/Overlook/actions/workflows/objective-c-xcode.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rcawston/Overlook/actions/workflows/objective-c-xcode.yml)

Overlook is a macOS-native remote console for GL.iNet GLKVM / Comet-style KVM devices.

![Overlook Screenshot](./OverlookScreenshot.png)

It focuses on *fast*, *low-friction* day-to-day “reach over and fix it” workflows:

- Low-latency WebRTC video streaming (Janus signaling).
- Full keyboard + mouse input capture.
- **Clipboard bridging**:
  - **Local → Remote paste** with `⌘V` (types the clipboard into the remote machine).
  - **Remote → Local copy via ML OCR**: select text directly from the live video stream using Apple Vision and copy it to your Mac clipboard.

If you spend time in BIOS/UEFI, bootloaders, headless servers, or “the machine that’s *just* out of reach”, Overlook aims to make the remote console feel like a first-class Mac app.

## Highlights

### 1) Copy from the remote screen using ML OCR

Overlook includes an **OCR Selection Mode** that behaves like “Live Text” for a remote computer:

- Turn on OCR mode.
- Drag a box on the video stream.
- Overlook runs on-device OCR (Apple Vision framework), shows the recognized text, and you can copy it to your clipboard.

This is especially useful for:

- Capturing one-time passwords, serial numbers, IPs, MAC addresses.
- Copying terminal output from machines with no clipboard integration.
- Copying text in pre-boot environments.

**Note:** OCR is performed locally on your Mac.

### 2) Paste to the remote machine with `⌘V`

Overlook intercepts `⌘V` while input capture is enabled and sends the macOS clipboard to the remote via the device’s HID “print text” API.

This replaces the old “Paste to Remote” settings UI: the workflow is now the shortcut you already expect.

### 3) Low-latency WebRTC video

Overlook uses WebRTC for streaming and collects receiver stats (bitrate, fps, jitter buffer / playout delay, decode time, packet loss, ICE RTT).

These stats are surfaced in the window title, which makes diagnosing latency issues and tuning quality settings much easier.

### 4) A focused Settings panel (WebUI-aligned)

The Settings UI is intentionally aligned with GLKVM’s WebUI behavior where it matters:

- **Video quality presets** (Low/Medium/High/Ultra-high/Insane/Custom).
- **EDID** selection and custom EDID entry.
- Audio + microphone toggles (reconnect required).

## What devices are supported?

Overlook is built around GL.iNet’s GLKVM/Comet HTTP + WebRTC stack.

In code, devices are modeled as `KVMDevice` and discovered/managed by `KVMDeviceManager`.

If you have:

- GL.iNet Comet / GLKVM
- A GLKVM-compatible device exposing Janus signaling at `wss://<host>:<port>/janus/ws`

…Overlook is intended to work.

For now, it's only designed for local network use or direct IP connections (e.g. over VPN).

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 14+ (deployment target in project is macOS 14.0).
- Xcode (use the repository’s `Overlook.xcodeproj`).
- Network access to your KVM device.

### WebRTC dependency

Overlook uses the Swift Package:

- `https://github.com/stasel/WebRTC` (pinned in `Package.resolved`)

### Build

1. Open `Overlook.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the `Overlook` scheme.
3. Build + Run.

For a local command-line Release build, use `scripts/build-agent-release.sh`.
It sets `CC` to the local `scripts/clang-pipe-compat` helper for the older
SwiftBuild Clang-discovery pipe behavior. The helper preserves complete
stdout and stderr output and delegates every other compiler invocation to the
original Xcode Clang; it does not change Xcode or Apple compiler files. The
underlying SwiftBuild stream fix is tracked in [Apple SwiftBuild PR #1315](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build/commit/5d489960935c30989d6f4398b675be6218913fac).
Detailed recovery evidence and complete build outputs are retained under
`/Users/doebber/Documents/Wago/work/overlook-session-refactor-evidence-2026-09-15/compiler-recovery-2026-09-15/`.

## Quick Start (How to use Overlook)

### 1) Discover or add a device

Overlook supports multiple discovery methods (mDNS + network scanning + common target probes) and also manual entry.
Automatic scan results are shown only when TCP port 443 is reachable. Manually added and saved devices remain available regardless of their configured port.

From the main window:

- Click **Scan** to search your network.
- Or click **Manual Connect…** to enter host/IP and port.

From the menu bar:

- Use the Overlook status item to scan and connect quickly.

### 2) Connect

Select a device, then connect.

On connect, Overlook will:

- Authenticate to the device API (cookie token).
- Enable HID on the device.
- Start WebRTC streaming.
- Start keyboard/mouse capture.

If authentication fails, you’ll be prompted for a password and Overlook will attempt a login.

### 3) Control the remote machine

Once connected:

- Mouse movement, clicks, dragging, and scroll are forwarded.
- Keyboard is captured and forwarded.
- Standard UX flows like fullscreen work well for “monitor replacement” usage.

## OCR Copy Mode (Remote → Local)

### Enable OCR mode

You can enable OCR mode from:

- The main toolbar button (document/text icon).
- The fullscreen hover controls.
- The menu bar item (also supports a global shortcut).

When OCR mode is enabled:

- Overlook captures video frames from the WebRTC stream.
- It periodically detects text regions and overlays bounding boxes.

### Select text

OCR selection supports two gestures:

- **Click:** OCR a small region around the click point.
- **Drag a rectangle:** OCR the selected region.

Overlook then shows a “Recognized Text” sheet where you can:

- Copy the recognized text to your macOS clipboard.
- Close the sheet.

### Notes / limitations

- OCR accuracy depends on resolution, compression, font size, and contrast.
- OCR is currently tuned for English but uses automatic language detection.
- OCR works even when the remote machine has no clipboard support.

---

## Clipboard Paste (Local → Remote)

### Paste with `⌘V`

When connected and input capture is active:

- Press `⌘V` on your Mac.
- Overlook reads your macOS clipboard and sends it to the remote machine via the device’s HID text entry API.

This is ideal for:

- Commands
- URLs
- Password manager output (use responsibly)
- Small scripts / config snippets

### Tips

- If you paste a very large block of text, the remote side may take time to process.
- For best reliability, paste smaller chunks when interacting with BIOS/UEFI or slow boot environments.

---

## Keyboard shortcuts

Overlook includes a few “quality of life” shortcuts.

### In-session shortcuts (while keyboard capture is enabled)

- `⌘C`: toggles OCR selection mode (so you can “copy” from the remote screen).
- `⌘V`: pastes macOS clipboard to the remote.

### Menu bar global shortcuts

The menu bar agent listens for global shortcuts using `⌘⇧` modifiers:

- `⌘⇧O`: Toggle OCR.
- `⌘⇧R`: Scan for devices.
- `⌘⇧V`: Open Quick Connect.

(These are intended as fast, “from anywhere” actions.)

---

## Settings

Overlook’s settings UI lives in `Overlook/WebUISettingsPanel.swift` and is designed to map closely to the GLKVM WebUI.

### Video

- **Mode**: video processing mode (low-latency oriented).
- **Quality Presets**:
  - Low: `h264_bitrate=500`, `h264_gop=30`, `stream_quality=0`
  - Medium: `h264_bitrate=2000`, `h264_gop=30`, `stream_quality=1`
  - High: `h264_bitrate=5000`, `h264_gop=60`, `stream_quality=2`
  - Ultra-high: `h264_bitrate=8000`, `h264_gop=60`, `stream_quality=3`
  - Insane: `quality=100`, `h264_bitrate=20000`, `h264_gop=60`, `stream_quality=3`
  - Custom: unlocks the advanced streamer controls

- **EDID**:
  - Pick from known-good EDID presets.
  - Or choose “Custom” and paste your own EDID blob.

### Audio

- Audio output toggle.
- Microphone toggle.

**Important:** the UI indicates reconnect is required for audio/mic changes.

---

## Troubleshooting

### “I can’t find my device when scanning”

- Make sure your Mac is on the same network as the KVM.
- Confirm that TCP port 443 is reachable from the Mac.
- Try **Manual Connect…** with the host/IP and port.
- Some networks block mDNS; Overlook also does a best-effort port scan and probes common targets.

### “WebRTC connects but video is blank / unstable”

- Confirm the device’s WebUI works.
- Try toggling reconnect.
- Check the window title stats (bitrate/fps) to confirm frames are arriving.

### “OCR doesn’t detect text”

- Increase stream quality (higher bitrate helps OCR).
- Make the text larger on the remote side.
- Avoid heavy compression artifacts (try High/Ultra-high/Insane).

### “Paste doesn’t work”

- Ensure you’re connected.
- Ensure input capture is active.
- Confirm the remote cursor focuses a text field.

### Local verification and build inventory

The Xcode target lists its Swift source files explicitly. The MCP package compiles
`src/**/*.ts`; alternate source copies must be kept outside those source folders.
The release script fingerprints the app, project, build scripts, and MCP sources,
then writes the revision and content digest into the app and its build manifest.

- `scripts/test-agent-control.sh all`: local fixtures for session replacement,
  input capture, AppKit keyboard routing, HTTP/WebSocket contracts, snapshots,
  control server, and the MCP package. Set `OVERLOOK_WEBRTC_FRAMEWORK_DIR` to the
  parent of the resolved macOS `WebRTC.framework`. Install the locked MCP
  dependencies before running the MCP suite.
- `scripts/build-agent-release.sh <output-directory>`: creates and verifies an
  Apple Development signed Release artifact without installing or restarting
  Overlook. Set `OVERLOOK_SIGN_IDENTITY` to an available Apple Development
  identity; the script signs the embedded framework before the app and checks
  that both signatures carry the same Team ID. An external output directory can
  keep build products out of the source provider, for example
  `$HOME/Library/Caches/Overlook/agent-release`. `OVERLOOK_SOURCE_PACKAGES_PATH`
  can reuse an existing resolved package cache.

Capture tests use hidden native AppKit windows and fake transport sinks. They do
not establish visible text-field behavior or acceptance against a live KVM.

### Security notes

- The app currently allows insecure TLS for device connections (useful for devices with self-signed certs).
- Treat your `auth_token` like a password.
